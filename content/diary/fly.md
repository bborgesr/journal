2016 was a remarkably, magnificently shitty year. 2017 followed in its brave, distinct footsteps. And we're all caught up. It's 2018 now, and we were heading for another sorry excuse of a year. But then "a series of intense or extraordinary events, which, as of now, seem unconnected, with the exception of each being separately bizarre" [^fn1] bloomed in my life. I started dreaming of flying again, Elon Musk launched Falcon Heavy months after announcing manned missions to Mars on yet unseen BFR starting as early as 2024. I even created a Spotify playlist named _Fly_ (which is a beautiful-ass song too) and started obsessively watching the incredible _Everyday Astronaut_ on youtube[^fn2]. So, flying is obviously a theme here. And "out" seems to be another one, as in _Mars out_, kinda out. Can you imagine being able to start over? From scratch? Can you imagine 38% percent gravity (it's the fastest, healthiest way to lose 62% of your weight!<sup>TM</sup>)

Anyway, the long rambling point is simply that the idea of flying, the idea of Mars, the idea that "sometimes, though, pipe dreams spill over into reality"[^fn3] is beginning to feel inspiring, even real at times, again. So, I'm going to hold on to that. I wanna go to Mars. And I want to continue dreaming of flying, And I wanna continue living with my head among the clouds, reading and writing and building whatever the fuck I want. And then one day I'll take that all to Mars, and _that_ will be the trip of a lifetime.

[^fn3]: _The Elegant Universe_, Brian Greene, in "Beyond Strings" -> "The Equations of String Theory". page 297. Here's the context for this beautifully quotable sentence in the book: _By the early 1990s, the latter two possibilities made it clear to most string theorists that complete reliance on the perturbative framework was standing squarely in the way of progress. The next breakthrough, most everyone in the field agreed, would require a nonperturbative approach - an approach that was not shackled to approximate calculational techniques and could therefore reach well beyond the limitations of the perturbative framework. As of 1994, finding such a means seemed like a pipe dream. Sometimes, though, pipe dreams spill over into reality._
