- [`shiny-dev-center` issue tracker](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny-dev-center/issues)

- [articles to be written (#65)](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny-dev-center/issues/65)

- [should have an article on eager vs lazy reactivity (#82)](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny-dev-center/issues/82):

  - This issue has come up a number of times, most recently in `rstudio/shiny#1868`: [the descendants of reactive() react while the value does not change (#1868)](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/issues/1868)
  
  - Joe's draft (on disk already)

- [need an article on lazy evaluation (#76)](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny-dev-center/issues/76):

  - People often run into problems with lazy evaluation and it would be nice to point them to an article about it. I just answered one issue on it, and I think the code examples are simple enough for people to understand: `rstudio/shiny#1855`: [problem passing reactive in modules (#1855)](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/issues/1855)
  
     - [This stackoverflow post talks about it a bit -- i.e. the differences between reactives and observers](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39436713/r-shiny-reactivevalues-vs-reactive/39441145#39441145)
  
  - [my gist on the matter](https://gist.github.com/bborgesr/e1ce7305f914f9ca762c69509dda632e)
